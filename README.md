RMA4Salesforce
==============
Mostly just me having some fun -- I don't know much about the RMA process.
For this one, you can add a "create RMA" button to the Case and Opportunity pages.
You can add RMA Items based on Opportunity Line Items.
And you can set things like Max Case Age, Max Opportunity Age, Restocking fee etc.

If you have ideas on how to improve it, feel free to let me know or fork the heck out of it.

Here's a beta managed package in case you're interested.
